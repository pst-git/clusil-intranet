<h3>Access the filesystem (WebDAV)</h3>
<p>The CLUSIL Member Intranet filesharing system is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webdav" target="_blank">WebDAV</a> based.</p>
<p>All CLUSIL Member Users have access to the WebDAV. Depending on the affiliation to a Working/Ad-Hoc Group, the same username and password gives access to the Group's documents via the following: <b><i>https://intranet.clusil.lu/[wg-acronym]</i></b> (acronym must be in lowercase!). To read on how to use the web interface to the file sharing platform, see below.</p>
<p>Alternatively, and for best user experience, use your standard "file manager" to <i>"map a drive"</i> to the Group's repository.</p>
<p>Find herebelow screenshots on how to set this up on Windows 7:</p>
